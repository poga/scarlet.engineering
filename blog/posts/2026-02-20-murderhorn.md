I'm a big fan of short incremental games with cool narratives. Games like [Digseum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3361470/Digseum/) and [1,000,000 Shrimps](https://jontopielski.itch.io/1000000-shrimp) are delightful and memorable.

I made a game that's heavily inspried by them. Try it here:

Last week I did my first hiking with my wife. During the trip I keep thinking about an old saying: "You cannot speak of ice to a summer insect"(夏蟲不可語冰). How would a mountain feel when there's all these short-lived humans walking on top if it? Probably nothing.

Hence the game. It's deliberately short. Because we're all just summer insects.

Hope you enjoyed it.
